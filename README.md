ðŸŒŸ **Excited to share my latest project!** ðŸŒŸ

As part of my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS , I created an **HR Analytics Dashboard** using Power BI. This project provided valuable insights into employee attrition and key workforce metrics. Here are some of the key findings:

ðŸ“Š **Overall Workforce:**
- Total Employees: 1,470
- Attrition: 237
- Attrition Rate: 16%
- Active Employees: 1,233
- Average Age: 37

ðŸ“Š **Department-wise Attrition:**
- R&D: 133
- Sales: 92
- HR: 12

ðŸ“Š **Educational Field-wise Attrition:**
- Life Sciences: 89
- Medical: 63
- Marketing: 35
- Technical: 32
- Other: 11
- Human Resources: 7

ðŸ“Š **Attrition Rate by Gender & Age Group:**
- Under 25: Female (18), Male (20)
- 25-35: Female (43), Male (69)
- 35-44: Female (14), Male (37)
- 45-54: Female (9), Male (16)
- Above 55: Female (3), Male (8)

This dashboard provided clear insights into attrition trends and will help organizations understand where they can focus retention efforts.
